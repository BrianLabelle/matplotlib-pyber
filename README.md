# Data Analysis | Three observable trends based on the data

Because it was suggested that I possibly choose the assignment based on ‘the one most relevant to your future career.”, I choose the Pyber assignment because it is relevant to my current career working in the auto industry.

1.	When comparing the 2016 Pyber Ride Share Data between the average fare and the total number of riders in the different city types of Urban, Suburban and Rural, it’s not surprising to see that the total number of riders is significantly higher in the urban areas than the rural areas. The bubble graphs clearly supports the fact that urban areas are more densely populated thus having a stronger customer base which better supports the ride share business model. 

2.	 While the number of riders in the rural area is less than urban, there is a significant higher average fare with the obvious implication of a longer distance travelled. It would be interesting to plot airport locations distances in the rural areas to see what percentage of these rural fares have airports as a destination.

3.	Despite my error in counting driver counts, there is still a relevant trend that there are more drivers in the urban areas because of the demand created by the city dwellers. We can easily assume frequent short rides to work, to lunch, for entertainment purposes.  I would wonder again if the outlier Urban scatter point at the 40 number of riders / $25 fare would be to the airport as one of usually furthest destinations from a downtown area. Most ride shares have a flat rate to airports.
